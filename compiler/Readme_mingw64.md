# MinGW Compiler

The code from the cpp folder is pure c++ std=20 code.

Most compilers should do, especially clang and gcc.

Under MS Windows Visual Studio Compilers *can* do. However installing boost and a few other classical UNIX
libraries needs a professional. 

I use the mingw64 from here, which is the same which comes along with **Qt 6** !

I take it from here: https://github.com/cristianadam/mingw-builds/releases 

Presently it is x86_64-11.2.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v9-rev4, so:

**posix** threads and **seh** exceptions.
