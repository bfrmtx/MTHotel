ATSS
=======

atss is a **stream** ats file (the old data format of metronix since 1998, 
"**a**\ dvanced **t**\ ime **s**\ eries").

An .atss file contains a stream of *IEEE 754* double numbers. That is the default format on most computers
and is also the default format of C/C++, Python numpy and Matlab. A double is always 64bit.

is  an UTF-8 encoded text file, used for describing the contents of the stream.
